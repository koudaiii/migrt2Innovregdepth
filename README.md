## Migrate to Innovate and Transform​

- Improve your agility, security, scalability, and TCO when migrating
  your Red Hat workloads on a global, secure Azure cloud, powered by
  Intel technologies​

- Achieve up to a 192% 3-year ROI, while reducing data center spend by
  80% with Red Hat Enterprise Linux on Azure ([Forrester
  TEI](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-forrester-the-tei-red-hat-enterprise-linux.html))​

- Simplified management because Azure is the only cloud provider to
  offer Ansible, OpenShift, and JBoss as managed services

## Labs 

**Lab 1** - [Lab 1 - Preparing your lab
environment](https://github.com/technofocus-pte/migrt2Innovregdepth/tree/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%201%20-%20Preparing%20your%20lab%20environment)

In this Lab we setup the Azure Subscription and verify the on-premise
environment including 2 RHEL Linux VMs, and then setup the Azure Migrate
appliance to perform Discovery followed by Assessment.

**Lab 2** - [Lab 2 - Migrating Linux VMs to Azure using Azure
Migrate](https://github.com/technofocus-pte/migrt2Innovregdepth/blob/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%202%20-%20Migrating%20Linux%20VMs%20to%20Azure%20using%20Azure%20Migrate/Lab%202%20-%20Migrating%20Linux%20VMs%20to%20Azure%20using%20Azure%20Migrate.md)

In this Lab we will enable replication of the 2 RHEL Linux VMs, and then
perform Test migration followed by Migration and verifying that the
Website is functional after migration.

**Lab 3** - [Lab 3 - Migrating PostgreSQL to
Azure.](https://github.com/technofocus-pte/migrt2Innovregdepth/blob/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%203-%20Migrating%20PostgreSQL%20to%20Azure/Lab%203-%20Migrating%20PostgreSQL%20to%20Azure.md)

In the Lab we would be deploying a Virtual machine to host
the **PostgreSQL database** and create the required **PostgreSQL
infrastructure** and then we will migrate the PostgreSQL Database using
the **Azure Database for Postgres Flexible Server (Migration)**

**Lab 4** - [Lab 4 – Adaptive
Cloud](https://github.com/technofocus-pte/migrt2Innovregdepth/blob/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%204%20%E2%80%93%20Adaptive%20Cloud/Lab%204%20%E2%80%93%20Adaptive%20Cloud.md)

In this lab we will manage resources across environments with Azure Arc,
you can secure, monitor, and govern infrastructure across your
environments, including on-premises, other public clouds, and edge
devices.

**Lab 5** - [Lab 5 - Defender for Cloud &
Sentinel](https://github.com/technofocus-pte/migrt2Innovregdepth/blob/main/Lab%20Guides/Lab%205%20-%20Defender%20for%20Cloud%20%26%20Sentinel/Lab%205%20-%20Defender%20for%20Cloud%20%26%20Sentinel.md)

In this lab we will configure Microsoft Defender for Cloud. We will also
Setup Microsoft Sentinel and then configure Data connectors. We will
then enable integration between Microsoft Defender for Cloud and
Microsoft Sentinel to check the Incidents generation from the Alerts
generated in Microsoft Defender for Cloud
